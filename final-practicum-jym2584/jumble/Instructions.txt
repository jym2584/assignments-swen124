Jumble Solver is a backtracking solution to solving jumble word puzzles.
For example:  Jumble = ogd  Solved = dog.
The solver reads in a list of valid words from "words.txt" which you must use to
validate partial words as well as final goal words.

Your task:
Complete the JumbleSolver backtracking methods in JumbleSolver.java
    getSuccessors()
    isValid()
    isGoal()

*** NOTE ***  You MAY have to modify the PATH in the first call in Main()
              in order to get the words file to read properly

Expected Output:
   No solution found for jumble: zzz
   unf solution is: fun
   wlyasa solution is: always
   rshtea solution is: hearts
   blscu solution is: clubs
   dmersia solution is: misread
   seay solution is: easy
   No solution found for jumble: foobar

Hints:
1) In Java Strings are immutable
   so you can make a copy
   by simply creating a new String
   and assigning an existing String to it.

2) Java has a String method "startsWith()" which should prove useful

3) Java sets have a method "contains()" which should also prove useful

4) JumbleSolver implements Configuration which means 
   getSuccessors() should create a collection of ALL possible next Configurations.
