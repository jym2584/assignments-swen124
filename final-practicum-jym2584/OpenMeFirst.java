/**
 * This Java class has been provided to you to kick-start VS Code's Java 
 * Extensions and (hopefully) avoid the problems that some students have had 
 * with unrecognized Java Packages. Please run the class to make sure that VS 
 * Code is configured and recognizes that your project folder is the root 
 * source folder.
 * 
 * There are two problems on this practical exam. You will find the 
 * instructions for each in the "lighting" and "jumble" packages.
 * 
 * Scoring is as follows:
 *  lighting part 1 = 20 points
 *  lighting part 2 = 20 points
 *  lighting part 3 = 20 points
 *  lighting part 4 = 20 points
 *  jumble = 20 points
 * 
 * You can always receive partial credit for problems that you do not solve 
 * completely. Do not forget to commit and push your code frequently!
